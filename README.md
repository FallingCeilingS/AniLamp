- ### Short Description
    As in the video sample, the assignment implements all requirements.
    However, I would like to give the additional description for my assignment, which states as follows:
    - The program displays at 1920\*1080 resolution in the video sample. I have changed the resolution to 1280\*720 to ensure the user can see the buttons below the window intuitively when the run the code in your laptop. If you still cannot see the control buttons, please maximise the window.
    - Although the code ran by IntelliJ IDEA (a kind of IDE for Java) in the video sample, the code could be run from the command line on a standard Windows PC (has been tested on the ones in the Diamond).
    - It could take a while (roughly 10 seconds) for the window to display the scene since it needs to load textures.
    - The motion of lamp in the video sample is not smooth enough and jumps directions are wired sometimes because of the process of recording. It would not happen when you run the code.
    - The lamp can change different poses plausibly by pressing the "Random Pose" button.
    - Every time the lamp jumps, by pressing the "Jump" button, it will reset its pose at first, then jumping to a random place.
    - The buttons, "Random Pose" and "Jump", will be disabled for about 2 seconds after the action of the lamp has completed.
    - Please wait for the lamp to complete the jump (back in the table and restore the initial pose), then press the "Random Pose" or "Jump" button again, or the lamp will change the direction incorrectly in the next time.
    - The lamp can avoid intersecting other three objects on the table when jumping.
    - There are two objects on the table have a combination of specular and diffuse texture maps -- the lamp (the diffuse base and the specular arms) and the mobile phone (the diffuse frame and the specular screen).
    - The moving texture outside the window is fog.
    - The copyright of texture images states in the *.txt file in the textures folder.
    - The scene also satisfies other requirements in the assignment requirement PDF.
